The idea for my Mini NPC are as follows:

* Wanders around Level at Random

* When spots Player (must be facing), it will begin to shoot Fireballs at Player

* Player may recieve damage (25 hp per shot).

* Player may attack NPC (Not Implemented), and once shot, npc dies.



Those are my ideas for the mini npcs that I added to the test work. All the scripts are attached and should be working as intended, however it is not for me. The NPCs will not shoot at me, and I cannot seem to get their animations working despite it being the same animations as the player.
