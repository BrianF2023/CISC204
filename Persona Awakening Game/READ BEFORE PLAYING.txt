To add my own personal twist to the Memory Game project, I thought of an idea of adding a feature to the game Persona 5 Royal. If you're not familar with the series, it's essentially Pokemon but with Demons (with a significantly larger story). My idea was to add a game to the Velvet Room. Essentially, the more you match in the time limit, the more confidants that are increased. Confidants are a huge part of the game, and sometimes it is tricky to increase these levels, this would be a way to do so.
